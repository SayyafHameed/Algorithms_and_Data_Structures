# 6 Sorting Algorithms Every Developer Should Know

## 1. Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues looping through the list until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. The average and worst-case time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2), making it less efficient for large datasets.

## 2. Selection Sort
Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted part. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Selection Sort also has a time complexity of O(n^2), similar to Bubble Sort.

## 3. Insertion Sort
Insertion Sort iterates through the list, removing one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion of the list. Insertion Sort performs well for small, partially-sorted datasets, with a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases.

## 4. Merge Sort
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by recursively dividing the list into smaller sublists, sorting each sublist, and then merging the sorted sublists back together. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in both the average and worst cases, making it highly efficient for large datasets.

## 5. Quicksort
Quicksort is another efficient sorting algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the list and partitioning the other elements into two sublists: those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. The algorithm then recursively sorts the two sublists. Quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2) when the list is already sorted or reverse-sorted.

Radix Sort is another important sorting algorithm that you may want to include in the list of "5 Sorting Algorithms Every Developer Should Know". Here's a brief overview of Radix Sort:

## 6. Radix Sort
Radix Sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts the elements by processing the digits of the numbers from the least significant digit (LSD) to the most significant digit (MSD). It works by distributing the elements into different buckets based on their corresponding digit value, and then collecting the buckets back in order to get the sorted array. 

The time complexity of Radix Sort is O(d * (n + k)), where:

- d is the number of digits in the maximum element
- n is the number of elements
- k is the range of the input (10 if the elements are base-10 integers)

This can be simplified to O(d * (n + b)), where b is the base of the numbers (e.g., 10 for base-10 integers).

The key points about the time complexity of Radix Sort are:

1. It depends on the number of digits (d) in the maximum element, not the absolute value of the maximum element.
2. The time complexity is linear with respect to the number of elements (n) and the range of the input (b).
3. Radix Sort is considered an efficient sorting algorithm, with a time complexity that is better than the comparison-based sorting algorithms like Quicksort and Merge Sort, which have a time complexity of O(n log n).

The reason Radix Sort can achieve this better time complexity is that it avoids comparisons between elements and instead focuses on processing the digits/characters of the input elements one by one.
